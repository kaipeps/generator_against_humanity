# Generator Against Humanity
A web app 
based on a party game 
for horrible people.

## :page_facing_up: About
For this project, I'll be aiming to create a web app where users will be able to sign up to create and submit their own customised cards.
- Add in-app screenshots
## :pencil: Planning & Problem Solving
- Talk about the approach to the problem.
- Add screenshots/drawings of the doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.

## :floppy_disk: Cool tech
- Programming languages
- Libraries
- Animations
- Anything else you'd be proud to show your parents
## :wrench: Bugs to fix :space_invader:
- Jot any development bugs here, can also use this as a checklist to come back to and explain if/how I overcame those bugs
## :bulb: Lessons learnt
Things I learnt during development:
- Use this to mark down any interesting things I find as I go
If I had to start this again from scratch I would:
- Use this for notes on any hindsight 20-20 moments
## :clipboard: Future features
~~If I were to continue expanding on this as a side project, I would:~~
For this project I would like to include (by priority):
- custom card creation & submission
- browsing & saving of submitted custom cards
- an interface to randomly generate a question card and fill the blanks with selected answer cards from a user's saved cards
- API implementation to use officially published cards too
- inputs to only retrieve cards from certain decks for the generator
- (if I have the chance/time) a service to digitally play the game online with friends
