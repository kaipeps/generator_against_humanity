# Generator Against Humanity
A web app  
based on a party game  
for horrible people.  

> WARNING: If you aren't familiar with the original game, Cards Against Humanity contains some infamously offensive content. I have some options in place to hide said content, however I cannot guarantee full coverage.

## :page_facing_up: About
For this project I'll be aiming to create a web app where users will be able to sign up to create, save and submit their own customised Cards Against Humanity, as well as save cards created by others. Users will also be able to access a page where they can use their saved cards to generate randomised card combos and include officially published Cards through the REST Against Humanity API.
- Add in-app screenshots
## :pencil: Planning & Problem Solving
- Talk about the approach to the problem.
- Add screenshots/drawings of the doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.

## :floppy_disk: Cool tech
- Programming languages
- Libraries
- Animations
- Anything else you'd be proud to show your parents
## :wrench: Bugs to fix :space_invader:
- Jot any development bugs here, can also use this as a checklist to come back to and explain if/how I overcame those bugs
## :bulb: Lessons learnt
Things I learnt during development:
- Use this to mark down any interesting things I find as I go
If I had to start this again from scratch I would:
- Use this for notes on any hindsight 20-20 moments
## :clipboard: Future features
~~If I were to continue expanding on this as a side project, I would:~~
For this project I would like to include (by priority):
- custom card creation & submission
- browsing & saving of submitted custom cards
- an interface to randomly generate a question card and fill the blanks with selected answer cards from a user's saved cards
- API implementation to use officially published cards too
- minor javascript additions to make html elements interactive (i.e. collapsible menus) without having to redirect
- inputs to only retrieve cards from certain decks for the generator
- interaction to let players draw a hand of answer cards to use in the generator 
- (if I have the chance/time) a service to digitally play the game online with friends
